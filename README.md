# FHDW-Data-Technologies

This repository helps students at the Fachhochschule der Wirtschaft (FHDW) set up a working environment for the "Data Technologies" module. It focuses on using Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Express and querying databases from Visual Studio Code on both Windows and macOS.


## Getting Started

To get started, follow the setup guide for your operating system:

- [Windows setup instructions](instructions/windows.md)
- [macOS setup instructions](instructions/macOS.md)
- [VS Code usage guide](instructions/vscode.md)

You can also try out the example SQL queries in [sql/example.sql](sql/example.sql) once your environment is ready.
